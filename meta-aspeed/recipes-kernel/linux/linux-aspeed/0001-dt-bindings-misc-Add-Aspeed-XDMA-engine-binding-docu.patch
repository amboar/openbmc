+* Device tree bindings for the Aspeed XDMA engine
+
+The XDMA Engine embedded in the AST2500 SOC can perform automatic DMA
+operations over PCI between the AST2500 (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.
+
+Required properties:
+
+ - compatible		"aspeed,ast2500-xdma"
+ - reg			contains the offset and length of the memory region
+			assigned to the XDMA registers
+ - resets		reset specifier for the syscon reset associated with
+			the XDMA engine
+ - interrupts		the interrupt associated with the XDMA engine on this
+			platform
+
+Example:
+
+    xdma@1e6e7000 {
+        compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-xdma";
+        reg = <0x1e6e7000 0x100>;
+        resets = <&syscon ASPEED_RESET_XDMA>;
+        interrupts = <6>;
+    };
